title: Rodi - Dependency Injection for Python
no_comments: true

# Rodi is a dependency injection container for Python

```shell
pip install rodi
```

## Rodi offers...

- A **non-intrusive** implementation of dependency injection, that does not
  require modifying the classes it handles (no decorators are needed, no
  changes in injected classes).
- A strategy to better organize source code, reduce code repetition, and
  improve development experience.
- Simplified dependency management with automatic resolution and injection of
  dependencies, by type annotation in constructors or class properties.
- A fast implementation that performs code inspections only when necessary, rather than
  at each type resolution.
- A generic code API that can be used with any kind of Python applications.

## Getting started

To get started with Rodi, read the [_Getting Started_](./getting-started.md) guide.
