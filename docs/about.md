# About Rodi

Rodi born from the desire of using a `non-intrusive` implementation of
Dependency Injection for Python, that does not require modifying the code of
types it resolved using decorators, like most others existing implementations
of DI for Python. Type annotations make explicit decorators superfluous as
the DI container can inspect the code to obtain all information it needs to
resolve types.

Rodi is the built-in DI framework in the [BlackSheep](/blacksheep/) web
framework, although it can be replaced with alternative solutions if desired.
